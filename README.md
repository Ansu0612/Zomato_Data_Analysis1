🔑 Key Insights & Improvements

Pricing Strategy Matters 💰

Restaurants in mid-range pricing (₹200-₹800 per person) tend to receive higher ratings compared to very cheap or very expensive options.

A mismatch between food quality and price can lead to negative reviews.

Location & Popularity 📍

Highly-rated restaurants are often clustered in specific areas, suggesting location is a crucial factor.

Certain cities or neighborhoods have a high concentration of top-rated eateries.

Cuisine Trends & Preferences 🍜

Some cuisines (e.g., North Indian, Chinese, and Italian) consistently receive higher ratings.

Lesser-known cuisines may require better marketing strategies to gain popularity.

Impact of Reviews & Ratings ⭐

Restaurants with engaging and responsive management (replying to reviews) tend to have better ratings.

A few bad reviews can significantly impact an establishment’s overall rating.

Delivery vs. Dine-in Experience 🏠🍽️

Many users rate delivery-based restaurants lower than dine-in options.

Improving food packaging and delivery efficiency can boost ratings.
